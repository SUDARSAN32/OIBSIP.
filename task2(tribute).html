                <h4>December 23, 2004- Makes his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong. Is run out for 0 after
                    facing one ball, in a match India win by 11 runs.
                    <h4> April 5, 2005- The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper. After scores of 0, 12, 7* and
                        3, is
                        sent up the order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and proceeds to smash 148 off 123
                        balls
                        with 15 fours and four sixes, setting the platform for India's 356/9. The world wakes up to
                        Dhoni's
                        potential.</h4>
                    <h4> October 31, 2005: Dhoni stamps himself into the history books with a record 183* against Sri
                        Lanka
                        in Jaipur, helping India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare. Batting at No 3,
                        his
                        145-ball hundred makes a stiff target look well short and India go up 3-0 in the best-of-seven
                        series.</h4>
                    <h4>September 13, 2007: Dhoni's first international match in charge of India is a wash out against
                        Scotland in their ICC World Twenty20 opener. Few could have predicted how India's tournament
                        will
                        pan out.</h4>
                    <h4>September 24, 2007: India win the inaugural World Twenty20 by beating Pakistan in an absolute
                        humdinger in Johannesburg. Dhoni is an overnight sensation once more and the landscape of T20
                        cricket is changed forever.</h4>
                    <h4>September 29, 2007: Captains India for the first time in ODIs, in a washed out fixture with
                        Australia in Bangalore. Chasing 308, India are 9/1 when rain arrives.</h4>
                    <h4>October 2, 2007: In the next match in Kochi, Dhoni scores his first fifty as captain - 58 off 88
                        balls - as India are beaten by 84 runs to fall behind 0-1 in the seven-match series.</h4>

                    <h4>October 8, 2007: India's first ODI win under Dhoni comes in the fourth match of the series with
                        Australia, and the skipper leaves his imprint with 50* off 35 balls and two stumpings to be
                        named
                        Man of the Match.
                        November 15, 2007: First ODI series win for Dhoni as captain, as India beat Pakistan by six
                        wickets
                        in Gwalior to take the lead 3-1 in the best-of-five series. His contribution? An unbeaten 45 off
                        45
                        balls as 256 is chased with six wickets in hand.</h4>
                    <h4>March 4, 2008: A momentous occasion for India as they win their first ODI series in Australia.
                        The
                        landmark comes in the second final of the CB Series, which India win by nine runs to make it
                        2-0.</h4>
